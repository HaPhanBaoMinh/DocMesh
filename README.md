# DocMesh
DocWeaver is a lightweight collaborative text editor engine built with Go.   It synchronizes text changes from multiple users in real time using the Operational Transform algorithm.   The project includes a minimal React-based UI and a Go backend designed for clarity, extensibility, and full offline reproducibility.
